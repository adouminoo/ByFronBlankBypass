The Roblox Byfron anti-cheat is slowly rolling out with a new launch window. When you start up a game on Roblox, you may now see a black start-up window with the logo for Byfron in the top-left corner. But you may be wondering what this is all about, and what programs might be banned or blocked while playing Roblox. Here is a simple explanation of what this Roblox Byfron software is all about.

What is Roblox Byfron anti-cheat?
Exploiters BeGONE!

The Roblox Byfron anti-cheat, shown in the game’s new launch window, is a program that will combat cheaters and exploiters.

As far as what programs are banned due to Byfron, some popular ones like the Roblox FPS Unlocker, various shaders, and auto-clickers could be affected. According to a user on Twitter with screenshots of messages from Roblox staff, FPS unlockers and reshaders will not be banned.


That said, there is no official list of programs that are allowed with the Roblox Byfron anti-cheat. And getting caught by Byfron may result in your account being banned, so for now, we recommend not using any extra programs with Roblox.

Roblox acquired Byfron Technologies specifically to make new software that would prevent cheaters from breaking game on the platform. It’s taken Roblox a long time to catch up with other popular games like Fortnite on making anti-cheat programs, but now there’s some added security for the game that parents and players can hopefully rely on. This will help make the playing field far more fair, and provide some breathing room for Roblox developers so that they don’t have to make anti-cheat software on their own.
